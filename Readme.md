# *About this project*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

- The idea was of a place where I share the activities developed in the course and so I can use it for my portfolio and show my evolution as a Web developer.
- I'm still taking the course so this repository is under construction
- ✨Magic ✨

# Why

>This project is part of my portfolio, I will be happy to receive feedback on the project, on the codes, structure or anything that helps me evolve to become a better developer
